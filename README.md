ðŸ“Š #CafÃ© Revenue Prediction Model
This project applies linear regression to predict cafÃ© revenue using various business metrics. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and custom-built models, I analyzed the relationships between revenue and key factors like customer traffic, marketing spend, and order value.

ðŸ“Œ ## Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis: Uncover patterns, correlations, and insights.
Custom Linear Regression: Implemented from scratch with adjustable learning rates and epochs.
Feature Engineering: Introduced "Marketing Efficiency" and "Employee Productivity" metrics.
Visualizations: Intuitive plots to illustrate model performance and key trends.
ðŸ“Š ## Models Trained On:
